### What I Learned

Throughout this course, I've gained a solid introduction to Git and GitHub. I learned how Git helps with version control by tracking changes and facilitating collaboration. GitHub enhances this by providing an online platform to manage repositories, branches, and pull requests. I now understand how to clone repositories, make commits, and push changes, and I’ve learned the importance of using README files for project documentation.

### What I'm Still Confused About

I’m still a bit unclear on advanced Git commands like rebase and cherry-pick. Understanding when and how to use these commands effectively is challenging. Additionally, resolving merge conflicts in complex projects is an area where I need more practice. I’m looking forward to deepening my knowledge and gaining more hands-on experience.
